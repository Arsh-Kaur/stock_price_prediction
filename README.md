# stock_price_prediction
## Problem 1
Given a matrix A of m × n integers (non-negative) representing the predicted prices of m stocks for n days, find a single transaction (buy and sell) that gives maximum profit. \
ALG 1 - Design a Θ (m ∗n2) time brute force algorithm for Problem 1 \
ALG 2 - Design a Θ(m ∗n) time greedy algorithm for solving Problem1 \
ALG 3 - Design a Θ(m ∗n) time dynamic programming algorithm for solving Problem1 This Algorithm was implemented in two Tasks as 3A & 3B using Memorization and Bottom-up approach respectively.

## Problem 2
Given a matrix A of m ×n integers (non-negative) representing the predicted prices of m stocks for n days and an integer k (positive), find a sequence of at most k transactions that gives maximum profit. \
ALG 4- Design a Θ(m ∗n2k) time brute force algorithm for solving Problem2 \
